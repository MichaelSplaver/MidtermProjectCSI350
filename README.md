### Overview of Project
This website was created with the goal of displaying useful college information for students including teacher info, courses info, and assignment info. This website also provides an easy way for the user to view the data in a Web view, json file, or txt file. As an additional feature, this website also includes some aggregated data for the user to gain some insights on the available college data. The website is powered with a local database that allows for dynamic storage of the data that can easily be modified or added to.
### User Guide
I have created the following helpful user guide to assist users in the navigation and use of this website.
#### Page Navigation
The user may navigate between the available pages by selecting any of the links at the top of the page. They will remain visible at all times so its a great way to get around the website.

#### Home Page
The home page (first page you land on) is pretty basic, it contains two buttons that bring the user to the **USER GUIDE** *(this document)* and the **Contact Us** page. The contact page contains some addition information about me (the website creator) and provides a way of contacting me.
#### Teachers / Courses / Assignments Pages
These pages are all setup and behave the same. There's 4 primary features to pay attention to on these pages: The Data, `View as Json File` button, `View as Text File` button, `Downloads Page` button. The top portion of the page is **THE DATA** for the page, which contains the most important information regarding each respective area of the college ( Teachers / Courses / Assignments ). The `View as Json File` button will open a new page to display the data in the `.json` format. The `View as Text File` button will open a new page to display the data in the `.txt` format. Finally, the `Downloads Page` button will bring you the downloads subpage (additional information below) for the webpage you're currently on. 

##### Downloads Subpages
The Downloads subpages are simple pages that allow you to easily download the data displayed on the parent page. Currently `.txt` and `.json` file formats are available to download the data in.
#### Data View Page
The final page of the website is the Data View Page. This is a fantastic page for collecting and understanding the latest up to date information regarding the college. Here you can find interesting statistics such as: number of teachers, number of course, number of assignments, total points for all assignments in a course, total assignments per course, and total courses available per quarter.
